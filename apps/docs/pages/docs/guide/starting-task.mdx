# Starting Task

Starting a task in Kronash initiates the execution of the task based on its defined settings such as `duration` and `repeatCount`.

To start a task that you've already created, use the `start` method from your Kronash instance and pass the name of the task as an argument:

```ts
kronash.start('myTask');
// or
kronash.create(options).start();
```

In this example, the task with the name `'myTask'` would begin execution.

## Notes

Before a task can be started, the following conditions must be met:

1. The task must exist: You can't start a task that hasn't been created. Make sure to create the task with `kronash.create()` before attempting to start it.

2. The task must be in the `idle` state: In Kronash, a task that has just been created but not yet started is in the `idle` state. If a task is in any other state (`running`, `paused`, `stopped`, `finished`), you cannot start it again.

If these conditions aren't met when you call `kronash.start()`, an error will be thrown. Ensure these conditions are fulfilled to successfully start a task.

Once started, the task will execute its first "tick" after the amount of time specified by `duration`. The tick will repeat as specified by `repeatCount` and if `repeatCount` is not defined, it will run indefinitely until manually stopped, cleared or paused.
