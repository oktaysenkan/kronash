# Deleting Task

Handling and managing tasks is a critical part of any application, and at times it's necessary to clean up tasks that are no longer needed. Deleting a task in Kronash is straightforward and can be done in a single line of code.

To delete a task, use the `clear` method from your Kronash instance and pass in the name of the task that you wish to remove:

```javascript
kronash.clear('myTask');
// or
kronash.create(options).start().clear();
```

In this example, the task named `'myTask'` will be cleared.

### Notes

1. The task you are trying to delete should exist. Attempting to delete a nonexistent task will throw an error. Always ensure the task was created and is currently available before trying to delete it.

2. When a task is cleared, if it's currently active (running), it will be immediately stopped, and then removed. The `onEnd` callback won't be invoked in this case since the task didn't naturally come to an end but was forcibly stopped.
