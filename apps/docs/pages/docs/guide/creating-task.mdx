# Creating Task

Once the task is started, it will execute after `duration` milliseconds have passed, and then repeat as many times as specified by `repeatCount`. When it runs, the `onTick` function will be triggered for each execution and the `onEnd` function will be triggered after all executions have been completed.

This code creates a task with the following properties:

- `name`: A unique identifier for the task. Here, it's 'myTask'.
- `duration`: How long (in milliseconds) before the task should be executed. In this example, the task will execute every 5 seconds.
- `repeatCount`: How many times the task should repeat. Here, the task will run 3 times in total.
- `onTick`: A function to be executed whenever the task is executed (`tick`).
- `onEnd`: A function to be executed when the task has completed all executions.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a task:

### Single Execution

In many instances, you might need to execute a task only once after a certain delay. This is known as single execution and it's very straightforward to set up with Kronash.

```ts
const task = kronash.create({
  name: 'myTask',
  duration: 5000,
  onEnd(task) {
    const totalDuration = task.finishedAt - task.firstStartedAt;
    console.log(
      `Task ${task.name} ended after ${totalDuration} milliseconds in total duration.`
    );
  },
});

task.start();
```

### Multiple Execution

If you want Kronash to execute a task multiple times, that can be specified using the repeatCount property when you create a task. For instance, if you want a task to execute three times, you can do it like this:

```ts
const task = kronash.create({
  name: 'multipleTask',
  duration: 5000,
  repeatCount: 3,
  onTick(task) {
    console.log(`Task ${task.name} ticked ${task.timesExecuted} times`);
  },
  onEnd(task) {
    const totalDuration = task.finishedAt - task.firstStartedAt;
    console.log(
      `Task ${task.name} ended after ${totalDuration} milliseconds in total duration. Number of times executed: ${task.timesExecuted}`
    );
  },
});

task.start();
```

### Infinite Execution

While it's important to be careful with setting tasks to run indefinitely in order to prevent unnecessary resource usage, sometimes you may need a task to be executed endlessly.

```ts
const task = kronash.create({
  name: 'infiniteTask',
  duration: 5000,
  repeatCount: Infinity,
  onTick(task) {
    console.log(`Task ${task.name} ticked ${task.timesExecuted} times`);
  },
});

task.start();
```

### Notes

Remember, the provided `name` must be unique for each task. If a task with the same name exists, an `Error` will be thrown.
