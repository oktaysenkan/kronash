# Stopping Task

Kronash makes it easy to stop a task that is currently running, giving you an increased control over the task operations in your application.

Stopping a task halts its execution and resets it to its initial state, but unlike `clear`, it doesn't remove the task.

To stop a task, use the `stop` method from your Kronash instance and pass the name of the task you want to stop:

```javascript
kronash.stop('myTask');
// or
kronash.create(options).start().stop();
```

In this example, the task with the name `'myTask'` will be stopped if it's currently running.

## Notes

Before a task can be stopped, the following conditions must be met:

1. The task must exist: You can't stop a task that hasn't been created yet. So, make sure you've created the task with `kronash.create()` before attempting to stop it.

2. Task must be in the `running` state: A task can only be stopped if it is currently running. If a task is in any other state (`idle`, `paused`, `stopped`, `finished`), it cannot be stopped.

If these conditions aren't met when you call `kronash.stop()`, an error will be thrown. Ensure that these conditions are fulfilled to successfully stop a task.

After stopping, the task's state will be `stopped`, and its `remainingTime` will revert to `null`. You can then start the task again using the `start` method, which will reset its `startedAt` timestamp and run the task from the beginning.
