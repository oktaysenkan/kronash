# Pausing Task

Kronash provides the ability to pause a currently running task, something not directly manageable with JavaScript's built-in `setTimeout` or `setInterval` functions. This feature is especially useful when you want to halt the operation of a task temporarily and plan to resume it later.

To pause a task, you can use the `pause` method on your Kronash instance, passing the name of the task you want to pause as an argument:

```javascript
kronash.pause('myTask');
// or
kronash.create(options).start().pause();
```

In this example, the task with the name `'myTask'` would be paused if it's currently running.

## Notes

Before a task can be paused, the following conditions must be met:

1. The task must exist: You cannot pause a task that hasn't been created. Be sure to create the task with `kronash.create()` method before attempting to pause it.

2. Task must be in the `running` state: A task can only be paused if it is currently running. If a task is in any other state (`idle`, `paused`, `stopped`, `finished`), you can't pause it.

If these conditions aren't met when you call `kronash.pause()`, an error will be thrown. Make sure these conditions are fulfilled to successfully pause a task.

After pausing, the task's state will be `paused`, and its `remainingTime` will be updated to reflect the amount of time left until the task would 'tick'. You can later resume the operation of a paused task using the `resume` method.
